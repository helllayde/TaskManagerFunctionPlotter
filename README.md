# TaskManager Function Plotter
A simple Function plotter for Windows Task Manager Memory chart. This is a project I made for fun several years ago.
It uses a memory pooling algorithm to fast allocate and deallocate huge amount of memory in order to plot a given real-valued function in the Task Manager memory chart.
It may be surprising what kind of functions you may be able to put in your task manager!

## Usage
Just compile and run. It only works on Windows, of course, but you may want to adapt to your own system configuration if you want. I suggest to use MSVC to compile this file.
